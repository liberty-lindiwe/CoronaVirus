                      <p>In a new review of past research, Zhen Yan, a professor of cardiovascular medicine who runs a molecular exercise physiology lab at UVA, showed that exercise boosts the production of an antioxidant known as "extracellular superoxide dismutase," or EcSOD, which in turn, protects against acute lung disease and other diseases. </p>
                      <p>In particular, Yan said, the antioxidant can protect against acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, which is deadly in 45% of cases. ARDS affects up to 85% of patients in the ICU affected by Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.</p>

           <p class="info"> The virus can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, septic shock, and death. Many COVID-19 complications may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm. SARS-CoV-2, the virus, mainly spreads from person to person. It is important that you practice social distancing, because you can have and spread the virus without knowing it, you should stay home as much as possible. If you do have to go out, stay at least 6 feet away from others. Most of the time, it spreads when a sick person coughs or sneezes. They can spray droplets as far as 6 feet away. If you breathe them in or swallow them, the virus can get into your body. Some people who have the virus don't have symptoms, but they can still spread the virus.
              You can also get the virus from touching a surface or object the virus is on, then touching your mouth, nose, or possibly your eyes. Most viruses can live for several hours on a surface that they land on.

              <p>Fighting an invinsible enemy is not an easy thing to do. We cannot see the virus. So what should we say about this? Do we easily give in? If God is for us, no one can stand against us. God is with us. He sees it all, including viruses. He has no rival or equal and nothing can separate you from His love. So remember, you are more than a conqueror because of His great love.</p>
